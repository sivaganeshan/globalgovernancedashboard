      "content": "Why should people use this workstream? What is it for?\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will be used for a couple purposes:\n\nFirst, fund the hiring of a set of full-time “core developers”. Initially, this will include a set of engineers that are currently full time ShapeShift employees. How many is yet to be determined.\n\nThis Core Developer will have the following priorities:\n\n- Maintaining and running of ShapeShift production systems, both legacy and newly built systems. This will include a 24x7 on-call rotation.\n- Fix high impact bugs\n- Assist community developers on-boarding onto the application stack, conduct community developer PR reviews, and assist community developers with design decisions as needed\n- Make production-running legacy code bases either open source or deprecated\n- New feature work\n- Any other work that is deemed necessary or beneficial to the product suite and DAO, as determined by the workstream\n\nNote that priorities may change, but the intent is to coordinate resources for maximum impact on DAO productivity.\n\nSecond, funds approved for bounty work may be delegated to this workstream. This will support the coordination of multiple potential dev efforts.\n\nHow exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?\n\nThere are no other workstreams being considered to hire full time engineers and coordinate the overall development effort.\n\nWhat is the mission of this workstream? \nTo support a thriving open source development community and a decentralized infrastructure delivery effort. We are building a quality software product that delights and empowers our users and gives them sovereign protection of their crypto. We do this with decentralized back-end services and a web and mobile front-end.\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\n- Products working as designed, and available for use\n- Thriving open source community\n- New features added regularly (through both core dev efforts and community dev efforts)\n- Products developed to support use of tools for other workstreams to effectively accomplish their goals\n- Engineers should have fun\n- The priority / balance between each of these goals will change over time and as circumstances require\n\nWhat metrics can this workstream’s success be measured against?\n\n- Uptime. I am not sure what a realistic SLA target is for an actively-deving open source repository.\n- % of time core team spends developing in open source repos vs developing in closed source repos\n- count of bug tickets created, count of bug tickets resolved\n- Community developer commits\n- Discord community developer chat activity\n\nWhat should topics in this category generally contain?\n\n- Engineering Best Practices\n- Software and Infrastructure Architecture\n- Open Source Discussions\n\nDo we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?\n\nI don’t see a way around having this category.\n\nDependencies on other Workstreams\n\n- Engineering workstream would be more successful with a workstream that was available to conduct manual regression testing until test coverage supplants it. It is expected that the legacy codebase will always need manual regression testing.\n- Engineering workstream would need detailed product specifications to determine scope of work and to build new features / make changes.\n- Engineering workstream would benefit from a workstream that handled customer issued / relations and answered customer questions, and brought in engineers as needed\n\nWill your workstream hold recurring meetings?\n\nWorkstream will hold recurring meetings. Twice a month public demos will be held. Eventually weekly workstream kickoff meetings will he held on Mondays. It is expected that subgroups in the workstream may have their own recurring meetings as well. And bounty projects may have their own recurring meetings.\n\nTerm for Workstream Leader\nA yes vote on this proposal assigns Josh Forman as the workstream leader until Feb 28, 2022.\n\nVoting For this Proposal:\nCreates the Engineering Workstream as defined here and assigns Josh Forman as the workstream leader until Feb 28, 2022.\n\nVoting Against this Proposal:\nCauses no action to occur.",

The TWG recommends the FLI product revenue is routed directly to the [Operations Account](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFafd604d1CC8b6B3B6CC859cF80Fd902972371C1) when the fees are transferred from the vault to Index Coop.\n\nFrom the Operations Account, the TWG intends to periodically sell all the FLI revenue to ETH. The swap transactions are to be performed soon after being received within the Operations Account.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAfter modeling the past performance and much discussion, the Treasury recommends a more risk averse strategy be adapted with regards to holding leveraged products within the Treasury. The FLI products are designed for leverage trading and are priced accordingly.\n\nThe charts below compare the Book Value of the FLI products (Orange Line) the Portfolio Value (Blue area) and the Unrealised Gain/Loss (Grey Line). A grey line beneath zero indicates an unrealised loss relative to selling the FLI products at time of receipt into the Treasury. The key takeaway is downwards and sideway market conditions creates unfavourable conditions for holding FLI and as the treasury is not intended to be an active short term trader, the prudent approach here is to swap the FLI products for ETH.\n\nGiven the current developer workload, the TWG opts to perform the swap transactions manually and periodically soon after the Operations Account receives the fee income. We anticipate only a handful of transactions per month as the fee collector seldomly calls and this gives the TWG the ability to perform transactions in line with any pending financial reporting cycle. In the future, we can explore automated functionality such that the treasury just receives ETH instead of the various FLI products. For now, the manual lift to perform these transactions is low and TWG also benefits from building a track record of managing the communities capital.\n\n![|691x305](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/theindexdao/optimized/2X/8/83f126d97063b70d3d2a4d767efcbccf854f8eb9_2_690x304.png)\n\n![|691x289](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/theindexdao/optimized/2X/c/c1d0476b4a17fb8626191f43e6833288f8f8fefc_2_690x288.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe FLI products are amended such that the fees are deposited directly into the Operations Account.

      "content": "Initiative to begin the development of a comprehensive and streamlined repository of guides, visual media, documents, articles, blogs, and anything in between that one could find helpful in getting to know about ShapeShift, its services, the DAO, the FOX token, and the various ways to participate in the governance or DeFi aspect of FOX.\n\nThese crucial documents will then be translated on a rolling-basis to various languages of particular interest, staying true to our ethos of decentralization while increasing interest and demand for the FOX token.\n\nThis proposal was taken into heavy consideration for weeks and improvised several times. The initial polling showed [considerable support for the original proposal.](https://ethix.kr/assets/poll1.png) \n\n## Abstract\n\nShapeShift is an organization with a colorful history, highly respected leaders in the blockchain industry, and various top-of-the-line product/service offerings. As the company transitions into a fully decentralized organization, it is up to us, the community, to remain organized and efficient.\n\nInformation, the preservation of information, and the systematic process of sharing information has been the glue of human civilization and is arguably one of the most important functions in any organization, whether it be a for-profit corporation or a team of lawyers working on a case. \n\nShapeShift at the moment does not have an adequate information management system that is suitable for a DAO. **Information is fragmented throughout a chaotic mix of channels:** main website, Boardroom and Discourse, YouTube/Vimeo, docs and FAQs for each services, and a Zendesk. Each serve their own purpose in their respective areas, but this fragmentation of data leads to inconsistencies, confusion, errors, and in severe cases, security threats.\n\n**More Reading:**\n\n- [How It Benefits the DAO](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/workstream-proposal-internationalization-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-global-push-of-fox/355/32#how-it-benefits-the-dao-3) 🤜🤛\n- [How It Benefits the FOX Tokenomics](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/workstream-proposal-internationalization-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-global-push-of-fox/355/32#how-it-benefits-the-dao-3) 📡\n- [How It Benefits Future Workstreams and Projects](https://bootstraps.xyz/proposaluno/2.png) 🔍\n- [Benefits of a UIA for Enterprises](https://www.cio.com/article/2416284/five-advantages-of-unified-information-access--uia-.html) 💵\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\nI do not see a reason to delay the translation of documents for key languages where FOX would most benefit. To continue to ignore the international community would be ignorance on our part, and would not be in line with our ethos and core beliefs of true decentralization. \n\n> Information is power only if you can take action with it. Then, and only then, does it represent knowledge and, consequently, power. **- Daniel Burrus**\n\nTo add on to Burrus' quote, today's technology allows us to use information in efficient, smart, and seemingly magical ways that was never thought possible. It is a well-studied fact that good information management systems benefit enterprises tremendously. This workstream's attempt to collect and store all ethical and legal data pertaining to the DAO may also prove to be a great case study for future companies to study, as a company of this size and revenue deciding to decentralize all operations is a first. \n\n> ShapeShift ... demonstrated how an *old business* could operate in a *brand new way* because of the properties of cryptocurrencies. **Erik Voorhees, September 2015**\n\nAnd while ShapeShift is once again on a mission to prove this statement for a second time, it does not mean that the basic principles of business management should be thrown out the window. In fact, as a DAO it should be taken even more seriously as “decentralized” is likely to increase “unorganized” practices.\n\n---\n\n## Specification\n\n### Content Building, Globalization, and Raising International Leaders\n\nThe goal is to carefully vet and select qualified community members or anyone seeking to participate in our DAO as a contributing member that are qualified to speak, translate, and answer questions in key languages. The languages of particular interest are: Russian, Chinese, German, Korean, Japanese, and Spanish. These six languages were selected by a quick analysis of purchasing power, crypto adoption per capita, and innovation index in blockchain development outside of English speaking countries. \n\nThe languages are not fixed, rather fluid and will likely be filled in at different times depending on availability and demand. As new international members are added, new languages sections should be created in Discord and Discourse, which  will become the responsibility of the language leader to stay engaged in.\n\n[🔗 Read more on the new flexible timeline, responsibilities, and proposed process of onboarding new international team members.](https://www.notion.so/Globalization-Team-Members-efe9d21dcedb44fe957175516eb63d7c)\n\n---\n\n### FoxDoc Repo: Unified, Consistent, Pluggable and Usable Information On Demand for all Workstreams  📊 📚 📅\n\n![Frontend Dashboard](https://ethix.kr/assets/d1.png)\n\n- The FoxDoc Repo will allow community members to contribute to documents, guides, and miscellaneous information that is deemed needed by other workstream leaders as well as the ShapeShift Foundation.\n- The platform will keep track of contributors, the weight and quality of their contributions (weight calculated algorithmically, quality assigned by project leader), and will allow for the creation of more “mini-bounties” as we have seen growing lately in Discord.\n- This repo and the workstream will also be responsible for documenting and organizing information such as Weekly Governance Meeting Agendas and Their Summaries, Keeping Up-to-Date Information on Upcoming Events and Proposals, and will coordinate with the Community Mods to either assist or take charge of recording meetings.\n- The FoxDoc Repo will eventually be handed off to the ShapeShift Foundation and/or the Marketing & Growth workstream, whichever is deemed more appropriate. This is to protect the longevity and integrity of the repository regardless of the future workstream leader(s).\n\n**Preliminary specs, development goals, and vision for the [FoxDoc Repo can be read in depth here (will be constantly updated).](https://www.notion.so/FoxDoc-Repo-In-Depth-WIP-0e0785e5dd1e455c86dddd5fe2202fa2)**\n\n---\n## The following sections were cut out due to character limit issues on Snapshot.

Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.\n\n**Solution**\nQuoted from coderdan:\n\"There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.”\n\nThe “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee.\"\n\nFor now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc.\n\n**Candidates**\nTwo weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.\n\nSo now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:\n\nAngst, Jarrod, Kenymccornick, UnfitStone, Notorious_BTC, Doxy, Kokusho, Grip, Almond-Stew, Shanekoy and Moon\n\n",
